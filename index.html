                    Samir Khuller received his M.S and Ph.D from Cornell University in 1989 and 1990, respectively, under the supervision of Vijay Vazirani. He spent two years as a Research Associate at the University of Maryland, before joining the Computer Science Department in 1992, where he was a Professor for 27 years. He spent several summers at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, and also visited the IBM Tokyo Research Lab for several weeks. From 2003 to 2008 he was the Associate Chair for Graduate Education. and  he was the first Elizabeth Stevinson Iribe Chair for CS. As chair he led the development of the Brendan Iribe Center for Computer Science and Innovation, a project completed in March 2019. In March 2019, Khuller joined Northwestern University as the Peter and Adrienne Barris Chair for CS.
